# Reinforcement_Learning_Algorithms
This repository is the implementation (Tensorflow) of  classical Reinforcement Learning algorithms, which includes: PPO, DPPO, DDPG, A3C, AC, DQNs (Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Prioritized DQN), Policy Gradient, Q-learning , SARSA (SARSA-lambda). The algorithm's perfomance is checked  with OpenAI Gym, Mujoco environments. 

The contents are all in **master** branch. If you feel it's helpful, that will be great.
